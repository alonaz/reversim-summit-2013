Introduction to Storm
=====================
[Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm) is a distributed and fault-tolerant system for realtime computations.
It provides an elegant solution to a problem bugging those of us who work with big data: we have the resources to batch process gargantuan amount of bits, but lacked the tools to handle that data in realtime.

I'm going to show how and why Storm is the "Realtime Hadoop" that provides the missing piece of a simple, reliable, and _fun_ framework for streaming computations.
