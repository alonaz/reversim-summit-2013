Introduction to Storm
=====================
[Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm) is a distributed and fault-tolerant system for realtime computations.
It provides an elegant solution to a problem bugging those of us who work with big data: we have the resources to batch process gargantuan amount of bits, but lacked the tools to handle that data in realtime.

I'm going to show how Storm is the "Realtime Hadoop" that provides the missing piece of a simple, useful, and /fun/ solution for streaming computations, that is already [http://nathanmarz.com/blog/storms-1st-birthday.html](used with great success).
