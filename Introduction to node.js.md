Introduction to node.js
===
1. What is node.js
2. Apache vs. Nginx performance (One thread per connection vs. event loop) and what it has to do with node.js
3. Why javascript???
4. Express web framework
5. WebSockets and socket.io

I'm still not sure about the rest, I think there are two possibilities :
1. Large code bases with node.js (module development, deferred and promises etc)
2. Concentrate on examples and demonstrations of the node capabilities - telnet chat to socket.io chat etc...
