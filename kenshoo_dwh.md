Data warehouse the commercial and open source approaches
=========================================================

Tell the tale of [Kenshoo's](http://www.kenshoo.com) adventures while building a datawarehouse for its big-data


* what people do you need for the journey?
* what tools available? and which are best suited?
* should you go through the paid commercial fast road? or the yellow brick open source path?

* and most importantly.... why go anyways?

In this talk I will describe the experience we had with scaling our click tracking system using a no-sql solution (cassandra) and consoloditing our reporting data using GreenPlum DWH.
