Title: Gradle Plugins Building Blocks
===
In this sessions we'll see what makes a Gradle plugin and how easy it is to create one. We'll review the basic building 
blocks of a plugin, namely the plugin class, plugin's tasks, extensions and see how they all come together nicely. Then
we'll go into Gradle API to see what's useful and valuable is provided by the framework and how your plugins can benefit 
from it. Finally, we'll review examples of existing plugins and see how they make the Gradle builds more intelligent 
and powerful.
