Rants about Frameworks, Platforms and Libraries
===
work in progress

Analyzing horror stories like [Death by Redirect](http://wix.io/2012/12/09/death-by-redirect/),
[Jetty, Spring, C3P0, NewRelic, Jackson and Java Annotations Deadlock](http://wix.io/2012/11/12/jetty-spring-c3p0-newrelic-jackson-and-java-annotations-deadlock/)
or why did Hibernate did a "select * from [a really huge table]" and killed a JVM...
we will dive into what caused such horror stories and the question - can they be avoided.
Then, we will define what are frameworks, platforms and libraries, then dive into the topic of selecting
frameworks / platforms / libraries vs building your own.
We will try to share feedback about our (Wix) experience
with different frameworks / platforms / libraries -
what worked, what we think are good solutions, what we think were great but are now obsolete, etc.
